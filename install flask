To create a web application that facilitates the submission and display of code snippets with MySQL as the database backend, we'll use Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. We'll also use SQLAlchemy as an ORM to interact with the MySQL database.

First, ensure you have Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and MySQL Connector installed. You can install them via pip:


pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy mysql-connector-python
